Why is a tree appropriate for the doctor structure?
A tree fits the doctor reporting system because it models hierarchy naturally. 
Each doctor connects to their direct reports the same way a parent connects to child nodes, 
making it simple to trace relationships, add new doctors, or see how different teams connect.

When might a software engineer use preorder, inorder, or postorder traversals?
Preorder works best when you want to copy or export a full structure since it handles each parent before its children. 
Inorder is useful when the data needs to be read in a specific order, like in a sorted tree. 

How do heaps help simulate real-time systems like emergency intake?
Heaps make it possible to always process the most urgent case first. Each time a patient is added or removed, 
the heap reorganizes itself to keep priorities correct. This mirrors how real emergency systems constantly 
reorder patients to ensure that the most critical ones are treated right away.
